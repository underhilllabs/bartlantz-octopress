    <id>http://bartlantz.com/blog/2011/01/03/emacs-window-commands</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently bought a new large monitor, which opened the possibility of using Emacs with multiple, side-by-side windows.  Which is brilliant by the way!  Since I plugged it in, I've been "C-x 3"-ing like a madman.  My new favorite way to learn programming is having an info file open in the left window and in the right window having a scheme (or python) prompt open.  That is what I am doing now working on the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.  Luckily there was an <a href="http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/">info file available</a>.  I'm trying to think of a simple way to translate my programming epubs or pdfs into info files.<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redbike/5324820738/" title="SICP with Emacs by denverfiddler, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5324820738_4a77355d01.jpg" width="500" height="267" alt="SICP with Emacs" /></a><p>Anyways on to todays topic.  Emacs window commands!  <p>The first thing to keep in mind, is the difference between windows and  frames in emacs.  To emacs: a window is any portal to a buffer.  if you type in "C-x 2" in emacs and your view splits in half.  These two  portals are known as windows.  What we usually call a new window, is known as a frame to emacs.  So when you type in Ctrl-n in your browser and a new window pops open, in Emacsia, this is known as a new frame.<p><h3>Open another window:</h3><p><b>C-x 2</b>        open another vertical window.<br><b>C-x 3</b>        open another horizontal window.<br><b>C-x 4 b </b>     open a buffer in the other window<br><b>C-x 4 f</b>      open a new file in the other window.<br><b>C-x 1</b>        close all other windows, leave current window open. <br><b>C-x 0</b>        close current window, switch to other window.<br><b>C-x o</b>        move to other window<br><p><h3>Positioning windows:</h3><p><b>C-x +</b>      balance windows. This balances the size of all open windows.<br><b>C-x {</b>     widen current window.<br><b>C-x }</b>     narrow current window.<br><b>C-u C-x {</b>   widen current window by 4 columns.<br><b>C-u C-x }</b>   narrow current window by 4 columns.<br><p><h3>Scroll other window:</h3><p><b>M-C-v</b>     scroll other window<br><p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7035860407900002000-1347604681223856760?l=denverdroid.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[This Week's Emacs Commands]]></title>
    <link href="http://bartlantz.com/blog/2010/12/28/this-weeks-emacs-commands/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartlantz.com/blog/2010/12/28/this-weeks-emacs-commands</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you've ever played keywiz on Emacs: "M-x keywiz", you were probably eating humble-hacker-pie by the end of the game.  (For the uninitiated, keywiz is a game in emacs that's asks 10 random questions about key-bindings for some times obscure emacs commands.)  So far my top score is 4 (out of 10).</p>

<p>So what is a novice to do? I've decided to write commands I want to learn on sticky notes on my monitor until I memorize them.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here's this weeks list of new commands:</p>

<p>M-g g
goto line.  This command will ask for a line number and take you there in the current file.</p>

<h3>C-x v=</h3>


<p>vc-diff.  This command will show a diff between current file and HEAD in whatever Version Control System you are using.</p>

<h3>C-x vv</h3>


<p>vc-next-action.  This command will perform the next appropriate VCS command, such as add current file to staging, or commit.</p>

<h3>C-M-\</h3>


<p>indent-region.  If there is a defined region, this command will indent it.</p>

<h3>C-M-;</h3>


<p>comment-region.  If there is a defined region, this command will comment the region out.   (or uncomment a commented out region.)</p>

<p>A note: to define a region.  Do a C-[spc] at the beginning of the region and then move to the end of the region however you'd like (arrow keys, C-n, C-f, C-v).  If you can't see the regions add the following to your .emacs file: (transient-mark-mode 1).</p>

<p>Second note, in the above key combination, capital C, means hold the Ctrl key, capital M, means hold the Alt key.  If there are dashes between letters: type them together (or with C or M hold the Ctrl or Alt key while typing the other key.  So with M-g g: Hold Alt while typing g, let go and then type g again.)</p>

<p>Now off to work on a new version of keywiz, perhaps keywiz-jr!</p>

    <link href="http://bartlantz.com/blog/2010/07/09/cool-things-to-do-emacs-dired/"/>
    <updated>2010-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartlantz.com/blog/2010/07/09/cool-things-to-do-emacs-dired</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="sec-1_1_1">Delete some files in the <i>Downloads</i> folder </h2>




<p>My Downloads folder is always out of control. There are always a
ton of pdf files that I opened once in a browser but don't need to
save. It's a pain to open a GUI file navigator, like Nautilus, and
double click on each pdf file to view it and see if it should be
tossed. However with Emacs, trimming my Downloads directory of old
files is quick and easy.  </p>


<p></p>

<h2 id="sec-1_1_2">Viewing Pdfs in Emacs </h2>




<p>If you see a pdf with an uninformative name like 2010-09.pdf just
hit <<b>enter</b>&gt; when the cursor is on the file name, (when
the file name is at point). Emacs will open the pdf in a new
buffer. Once you have viewed the pdf and have decided its face you can
quickly kill the pdf buffer with '<b>k</b>' and you'll be returned to
the directory. Now, if the pdf is unimportant, queue it to be deleted
with '<b>d</b>'. If you want to keep the file, but give it a better
name, type 'R' to rename it. 

To unqueue a file for deletion, use '<b>u</b>'. And finally to
delete all the files currently queued for deletion, type 'x'.  </p> 
<p />

<p />


<h2 id="sec-1_1_3">Delete old Emacs backup files </h2>

<p>If you have a lot of backup files that emacs created with ~ appended to
the file name, you can quickly queue them all for deletion by typing '<b>~</b>'.
</p>

<p />
<h2 id="sec-1_3">Edit Zip'd or Tar-gz'd archives in place </h2>

<p>If you need to edit a file inside a zip or tar archive, simply open
the archive by hitting <enter&gt; on the name in Dired mode, then
click on the file. Edit the file and save it with '<b>C-x C-s</b>',
and then do another <b>C-x C-s</b> inside the zip buffer to save the
archive with the file changes. The archive will be compressed again
with your changes.  </p>

<p />
<p />
<h1 id="sec-1_5">Encrypt, Decrypt Files </h1>

<p>Use '<b>:e</b>' to encrypt the file at point. Emacs will ask who you want to
encrypt the file for (ie whose public key to use to encrypt the file.)
You can also encrypt the file symmetrically with a password. Once the
file is encrypted, there will be two files in the directory: the
original file and the encrypted file with '.gpg' added to the file
name. 
</p>

<p />
<h2 id="sec-1_5_1">Decrypt </h2>

<p>To open the symmetrically encrypted file, click on its name and you
will be prompted for a password. You can also type '<b>:d</b>' when
the filename is at point.
</p>


<h2 id="sec-1_5_2">EasyPG Assistant Docs </h2>

<p>The program that is used to encrypt the file's is EasyPG Assistant.

</p>

<p />
<h2 id="sec-1_7">Get More Help </h2>

<p>Type 'C-hm' (describe mode) while in dired-mode, to pop open a help
buffer, with a description of dired mode and a list of commands.
</p>
